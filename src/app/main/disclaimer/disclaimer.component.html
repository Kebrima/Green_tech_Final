HEVs are not eligible for the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project.</p><p class="intro">HEVs combine an internal combustion engine with an electric motor and batteries. They rely on gasoline or alternative fuel for power and are not plugged in to charge. Batteries are charged by the engine and when braking, a process called regenerative braking.</p><h3 class="bounded-title">Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV)</h3><div class="box"><img style="width: 500px; height: 300px" alt="Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle" src="https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/sites/default/files/images/nav/transportation/image_phev_vehicle.png"></div><p class="intro">For drivers who want an electric-only mode, but still need the option of gas to meet all of their driving needs. PHEVs are eligible for the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project.</p><p class="intro">PHEVs offer both gas-only and electric-only driving—even at high speeds. With smaller batteries than BEVs, they charge by plugging in and using regenerative braking.</p><h3 class="bounded-title">Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV)</h3><div class="box"><img style="width: 500px; height: 300px" alt="All-Battery Electric Vehicle" src="https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/sites/default/files/images/nav/transportation/image_bev_vehicle.png"></div><p class="intro">For drivers who want to achieve zero tailpipe emissions and have access to charging opportunities. BEVs are eligible for the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project.</p><p class="intro">BEVs use a larger battery to power one or more electric motors and can be plugged in at home, work or public charging stations. As a benefit, BEVs require limited maintenance—you will never need oil changes or new spark plugs again!</p><h3 class="bounded-title">Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV)</h3><div class="box"><img style="width: 500px; height: 300px" alt="Fuel-Cell Electric Vehicle" src="https://cleanvehiclerebate.org/sites/default/files/images/nav/transportation/image_hydrogen_vehicle.png"></div><p class="intro">For drivers who want to combine the zero-emission driving of a battery electric car with the refueling of hydrogen. FCEVs are eligible for the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project.</p><p class="intro">FCEVs convert energy from a chemical reaction between hydrogen gas stored in an onboard tank and oxygen from the air to power the vehicle’s electric motor. Refueling takes about 3–5 minutes, and most manufacturers provide free hydrogen fuel for the first three years of ownership.</p></div>
